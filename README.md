# [Project 1: Credit Default prediction using Neural Nerwork](https://github.com/souradipta93/Deep-Learning-AI.git)
* Created a tool that predicts credit default rate for India's top banks and help bank to analyse probability of default with 80% confidence.
* Prepared the neural network with more than 10K rows from bank database
* Engineered features of each description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel.
* Feature Scaling, Sandarized data, Importing Keras, Compiling DNN with 100 Epoches, 'Relu' as Activation function and 'Adam' as Optimizer with ' Binary cross entropy' as loss function and batch size is 10.
